# Continuous Intelligence and CD4ML For SageMaker

This workshop contains the sample application and machine learning code used for the Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML) and Continuous Intelligence workshop. 

This workshop is based on an existing [CD4ML Workshop](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/cd4ml-workshop).

This material has been developed and is continuously evolved by [ThoughtWorks](www.thoughtworks.com/open-source) and has been presented in conferences such as: ODSC Boston 2020.

## Pre-Requisites

In order to run this workshop, you will need:

* A valid Github account
* A working Docker setup with at least 20 GB of space free (if running on Windows, make sure to use Linux containers)

## Tools used in this workshop

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
* EFK Stack, [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) 
* [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/)

## Workshop Instructions

The workshop is divided into several steps, which build on top of each other. Instructions for each exercise can be found under the [instructions](./instructions) folder. To start from the beginning click [here](./instructions/1-SystemSetup.md).

*WARNING: the exercises build on top of each other, so you will not be able to skip steps ahead without executing them.*

## The Machine Learning Problem

We built a simplified solution to a Kaggle problem posted by Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer interested in improving their [Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/overview) using data. For the purposes of this workshop, we have combined and simplified their data sets, as our goal is not to find the best predictions, but to demonstrate how to implement CD4ML.
